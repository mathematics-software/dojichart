# DojiChart

[DojiChart](http://dojichart.com) is a JavaScript library for displaying candlestick charts and technical indicators using the canvas element.

## Install

```
npm install dojichart
```

## Features

- **Multiple chart panels** - A DojiChart instance comprises multiple chart panels, for example, a separate volume panel can be associated with a price chart panel.

- **Layers** - A chart panel has layers, for example a candlestick layer and moving average layer.

- **Responsive** - Charts are responsive, such that they expand or contract to fit their container's width.

- **Size and spacing** - The width of candlesticks and their intervals can be changed on the fly - this is equivalent to zooming.

- **Scrolling** - Charts can be scrolled forward and backward, either one bar at a time or by a specific number of time intervals.

- **Grid lines and labels** - Each chart panel can optionally have value and time grid lines and labels, which can be set to appear at specified granularity or automatically.

- **Crosshair** - A crosshair, implemented as a layer is rendered over each chart panel and reacts to mousemove events.

- **Events** - Click events on candlesticks is implemented and can be extended to cover other interaction events, such as touch and drag.


## Usage

Include the DojiChart CSS and JavaScript in the head of your HTML document:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="dojichart.min.css">
<script type="text/javascript" src="dojichart.min.js"></script>
```

Provide an HTML container element:

```html
<div class="dojichart" id="mychart">
  <div class="region" data-name="price"></div>
</div>
```

Instantiate the DojiChart instance, create a panel, add a layer and load some data:

```javascript
var dojichart = new DojiChart.core.Chart(document.getElementById('mychart'), {
  fieldMap: {
    time: 't',
    open: 'o',
    high: 'h',
    low: 'l',
    close: 'c'
  }
});

// Create a chart panel with a candlestick chart layer
var price_chart_panel = new DojiChart.panel.TimeValuePanel({
  primaryLayer: new DojiChart.layer.CandleLayer(),
  height: 200
});

// Render the panel in the region named 'price'
dojichart.addComponent('price', price_chart_panel);

// Dummy data
var data_arr = [
  {'t':'2015-11-11T17:25:00.000000Z','o':4672.3,'h':4675.3,'l':4671.0,'c':4671.4},
  {'t':'2015-11-11T17:30:00.000000Z','o':4671.5,'h':4675.1,'l':4671.3,'c':4674.5},
  {'t':'2015-11-11T17:35:00.000000Z','o':4674.5,'h':4678.6,'l':4674.5,'c':4676.2},
  {'t':'2015-11-11T17:40:00.000000Z','o':4676.0,'h':4677.3,'l':4674.5,'c':4674.9},
  {'t':'2015-11-11T17:45:00.000000Z','o':4674.7,'h':4676.2,'l':4673.2,'c':4673.3}
];

// Load data
dojichart.loadData(data_arr, 'EURUSD', 'M5');
```
